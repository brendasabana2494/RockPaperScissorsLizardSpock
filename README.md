# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock

Rock, paper, and scissors game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to make a rock, paper, or scissors. 
It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player.
However , what I have built is an advanced version of the game. The Big Bang Theory (Season 5, Episode 17) coined it "ROCK PAPER SCISSORS LIZARD SPOCK"
